            <section class="objSec"><p id="pa">During my time studying mathematics and physics it become appreciably clear that the most envied of traits was the singular ability to program and develop the tools required. I seek to be of service to an employer by growing my skill set of programming abilities thus ever more capable of performing at an accelerated pace. I am a quick learner who is not afraid to ask questions and research ideas until I have achieved my goals.</p></section>
